## Problem

Blockchain transactions often carry significant network fees, especially problematic for micro-payments or users in developing countries.

## Solution

When sending a transaction, users can choose:
- **Standard mode:** Pay the regular fee.
- **Ad mode:** Pay less or nothing, while the recipient must watch a short, non-skippable advertisement before accessing the coins.

The transaction fee is (partially) covered by advertisers sponsoring these ads.

## Benefits

- Users pay lower or zero fees.
- Advertisers gain targeted visibility.
- New monetization path for wallets and blockchain services.

## Use Cases

- Wallets supporting microtransactions  
- Airdrop and remittance platforms  
- Ad-sup
